The beauty of the heart

is the lasting beauty:

its lips give to drink

of the water of life.
Truly it is the water,

that which pours,

and the one who drinks.

that which makes,

and the other who eats. 

All three become one when

your talisman is shattered.

That oneness you canâ€™t know

by reasoning.

Mathnawi II, 716-718
